With this snowboard style, the front knee points forward \r\n\t\t\t\twhile the rear knee points backward. The upper body is aligned with the \r\n\t\t\t\tsnowboard.

The opinions on duck stance are more controversial. Many experienced \r\n\t\t\t\tsnowboarders that I have talked to, advised against duck stance since they got \r\n\t\t\t\tknee problems.
